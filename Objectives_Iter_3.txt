-Create the model for task, subtask, and finding.
    -please communicate with us. check the fields when creating your methods.
-add progress and # of systems, findings, etc. for the tables.
-produce tables that only include non archived events, systems, tasks, etc.
-might as well create the same for archived to create the archived view.

-Create View for task overview.
    -Task overview table and all tasks will lead to its own task
    -must be able to add event from overview page.
-Create View for task content view.
    -implement the functionality of all of the buttons (archive,save, and cancel...i dont know what demote is supposed to do).
    -for archive i will create a method you will call that method when you press that button then forward to the overview page the method will merely edit the attribute archived to TRUE.
    -Follow the same logic used for system and event for task. You will receive 2 arrays (you will more than likely have to call a method for all analysts but jebel will get u an array of analysts) for Analysts, collaborators, and related tasks. make sure that the ones that are realated are selected and when new ones are added the array is updated. (aka send the info to the controler)
-Create View for subtask.
    -same as task.
-Create View for finding content view and overview.
    -follow the same logic as task. Please communicate. This one will be tedius so we have to make sure that Jebel is feeding you the information that you need.
    -change button to read archive instead of delete and add functionality to archive, save, and cancel button.
Fix undefined offsets for system and event

Julio
-Create the controller for task.
-Create the controller for subtask
-Create the controller for finding
-Complete Event Team Information portion of event content view.

Will
-finish help
-use Jebel's database functions to create Analyst Progress summary.
-this entails finding all tasks subtask findings and systems an analyst is working on.
-build the controller and the view for it. Please follow naming conventions.
-Tables are already created all you need is to produce those arrays from the controller. (if worse comes to worse you can always do it in linear fashion and hopefully the tables will populate fast enough)
-keep in mind that this page will open when you click on a team member in the event team. The ID will be used to open the page.

Team
-Please verify work and test it before pushing.
-If an analyst uploads an attachment how does he view it after?

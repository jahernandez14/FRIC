- use same logic to create collection and model for log, analyst(add ip field). (not sure if system is complete)
- all returned values must be exact no extra data. i need one that returns
analyst initials and ips, i believe Daniel needs Analyst names for derived from, and one that returns system details, also an array of all of the log entries (DateTime, Action Performed, Analyst).


Daniel
-Implement the same event logic to system.
-deriverd from field should be a drop down that reads the analyst collection. (i do this with event name under set up if you want an idea) 
-add a log entry for your table class the 3 columns are DateTime, Action Performed, Analyst.

Julio
-session varible to manage who is using FRIC.
-log controller (i will save to the databse everytime the database is edited I will read the session variable for 
analyst name and the controller method call will indicate action taken)
-log view
-analyst controller
-modify set up to make more sense and more usable.


Will
- Finish help completely for both Windows and Linux also add a faq and tips. Everythng that must be know abour our app must be there.
for instance nust reside in a localhost, intended for 1080p, etc.
(I'm tempted to give you the team part for event detailed view...ill leave that up to Daniel)

team
-I think the addition of ID is required. will speed up searches
and allow for correct searches (id will let us know what type of data it is).
1####event
2####system
3####analyst
etc.

In addition it will help us avoid instances where something is duplicated
like in the demo.

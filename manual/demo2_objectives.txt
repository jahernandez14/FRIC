Jebel & Will
-Create FRIC database using Mongo (i think these are all the collections we neeed but not 100% sure)
    -Create event collection  
    -Create analyst collection
-Create php file that connects to database (using default account for now)
-Create classes that access, modify, and send atomic data to controller (more on that late basically add, delete, edit, that kinda stuff, once i build the controller methods yopu will have more of an idea)
-methods to populate the table (No. of systems, No. of Findings)

Daniel
-Make table dynamic (create it based on data, add, delete, etc.).
-Action listener that will display event detail view for event when clicked upon.
-Event detail view must be an overlay now. (Event Team information is part of the team information).
-Also add listeners to the add and delete button and also the check boxes (i dont know what the fucntion of save and cancel are, we may have them in the wrong area)
-Make the event tree menu hideable (i can do this if you want, let me know).

Julio
-Create controller methods for set up, and event view
-Fix UI to meet client recomendations and improve UI.
-Improve event tree.

Julio & Daniel
-Session variable (we got to find a way to do this more than likely this will be related to the database connection)

All
-Add documentation for tool dependencies or installations, etc.


I believe this is all but not 100% sure. Do add whatever I may have mised.
